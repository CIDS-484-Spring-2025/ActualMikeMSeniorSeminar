# Senior Seminar Project
## Description of project.
The game I am creating for this class is a 2D RPG (role-playing game) that will use styles and mechanics similar to those in Undertale.
## Progress
The progress so far has been creating the starting scene. In this scene, the player can move around with the arrow keys, pick up weapons and items, and even enter a fight. During a fight, they can flee, spare, attack, or get information about the monster (also working on this functionality). After the fight, the player keeps all the items and weapons they had before entering. The battle system is almost complete besides the fact that I need to add a condition on when someone can spare an enenmy and get the information button to work.  I have udpadted the sarting scene to be more full and more of the enviroment I want it to actually have. I have created a menu that can resume and pause the game, show your inventory for itmes picked up, credits and a quit function. Currently, there arenâ€™t any bugs, and the game runs smoothly. For milestone 3 I plan on crreating a shop where you can buy items save points and create the other levels.
