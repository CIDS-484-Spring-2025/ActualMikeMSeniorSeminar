# Senior Seminar Project
## Description of project.
The game I am creating for this class is a 2D RPG (role-playing game) that will use styles and mechanics similar to those in Undertale.
## Progress
The progress so far has been creating the starting scene. In this scene, the player can move around with the arrow keys, pick up weapons and items, and even enter a fight. During a fight, they can flee, spare, attack, or get information about the monster (I'm also working on this functionality). After the fight, the player keeps all the items and weapons they had before entering. The battle system is almost complete, except that I need to add a condition for when someone can spare an enemy and get the information button to work. I have updated the starting scene to be more complete and better reflect the environment I want. I have created a menu that can resume and pause the game, show the inventory for items picked up, display credits, and provide a quit function. In addition to this, I have created a health system, an enemey and a player attack system and item usage that will restore or bring up the players health. Currently, there arenâ€™t any bugs, and the game runs smoothly. For milestone 3, I plan on creating a shop where you can buy items, adding save points, have a maximum player health and developing the other levels.
