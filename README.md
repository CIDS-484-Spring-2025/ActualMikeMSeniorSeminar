# Senior Seminar Project
## Description of project.
The game I am creating for this class is a 2D RPG (role-playing game) that will use styles and mechanics similar to those in Undertale.
## Progress
The progress so far has been creating the starting scene. In this scene, the player can move around with the arrow keys, pick up weapons and items, and even enter a fight. During a fight, they can flee, spare, attack (still working on the functionality of this button), or get information about the monster (also working on this functionality). After the fight, the player keeps all the items and weapons they had before entering. The starting scene itself isn’t very polished yet since I’ve been focusing on functionality. Currently, there aren’t any bugs, and the game runs smoothly.
