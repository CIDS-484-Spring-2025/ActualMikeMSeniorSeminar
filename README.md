# Senior Seminar Project
## Description of project.
The game I am creating for this class is a 2D RPG (role-playing game) that will use styles and mechanics similar to those in Undertale. A working title for the game is Dinocalypse. In this game, you are stranded in a strange land that seems familiar yet out of its time period. Could this possibly be the Earth you know, or are you the one out of place? The story is that this world only has dinosaurs in it and you don't know why so you are trying to solve the mystery.
## Progress
The progress so far has been creating the starting scene. In this scene, the player can move around with the arrow keys, pick up weapons and items, and even enter a fight. During a fight, they can flee, spare, attack, or get information about the monster. After the fight, the player keeps all the items and weapons they had before entering. The battle system is almost complete, except that I need to add a condition for when someone can spare an enemy and get the information button to work. I have updated the starting scene to be more complete and better reflect the environment I want. I have created a menu that can resume and pause the game, show the inventory for items picked up, display credits, and provide a quit function. In addition to this, I have created a health system, an enemey and a player attack system and item usage that will restore or bring up the players health. I have completed mostly of what I had promised for this milestone like item shops, a save system but I added new enenmy attacks, a condition to get the spare button to turn on after going to the information button in the fight 3 times and a deathscreen. Currently, there is a one bug that I haven't been able to fix yet but it should be solved before the semester is over.
